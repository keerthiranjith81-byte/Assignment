    <p><b>Teamwork</b> is the collaborative effort of a group to achieve a common goal or to complete a task in an effective and efficient way.Teamwork is seen within the framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal.The four key characteristics of a team include a shared goal, interdependence, boundedness, stability, the ability to manage their own work and internal process, and operate in a bigger social system.</p>
    <p>Teams need to be able to leverage resources to be productive (i.e. playing fields or meeting spaces, scheduled times for planning, guidance from coaches or supervisors, support from the organization, etc.), and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone to have a clear purpose.Teamwork is present in contexts including an industrial organization (formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams). In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate (e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and collaboration present between team members.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The <u><strong>Oxford English Dictionary</strong></u> records the use of <i>"team-work"</i> in the context of a team of draught animals as early as 1800.</p>
            <p>Even though collaborative work among groups of individuals is very prominent today, that was not the case over half a century ago. The shift from the typical assembly line to organizational models that contained increasing amounts of teamwork first came about during World War I and World War II, in an effort for countries to unite their people. The movement towards teamwork was mostly due to the <b>Hawthorne studies</b> , a set of studies conducted in the 1920s and 1930s that suggested positive aspects of teamwork in an organizational setting. After organizations recognized the value of teamwork and the positive effects it had on companies, entire fields of work shifted from the typical assembly line to the contemporary <b>High Performance Organizational Model</b></p>

            <h2>Effective teamwork characteristics</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> A team must have certain interrelated characteristics to work effectively.Among these is strong group cohesion. There is a positive relationship between group cohesion and performance.Communication is another vital characteristic for effective teamwork.<b>Members must be able to effectively communicate with each other to overcome obstacles, resolve conflict, and avoid confusion. Communication increases cohesion.</b></p>
            <P>Communication helps to clearly define the team's purpose so that there is a common goal. Having a common goal increases cohesion because all members are striving for the same objective and will help each other achieve their goals.Commitment occurs when members are focused on achieving the team's common.<strong>Accountability is necessary to ensure milestones are reached and that all members are participating. Holding members accountable increases commitment within team relations.</strong></P>

            <h2>Drawbacks and benefits</h2>
            <hr>
            <p><b><u>Utilizing teamwork is sometimes unnecessary and can lead to teams not reaching their performance peak. Some of those disadvantages include:</u></b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><mark>Behavioral conflicts or ingrained individualism</mark> Employees at higher organizational levels have adapted to positions that require more individual initiative, and therefore have trouble engaging in collaborative work. This creates a more competitive environment with less communication and more conflict. This disadvantage is mostly seen in organizations that utilize teamwork in an extremely hierarchical environment.</p></li>
                <li><p><mark>Groupthink</mark>: This is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people when, from a desire for conflict-avoidance, the desire for cohesiveness is greater than the desire for the best decisions. When a team experiences groupthink, alternative solutions will not be suggested due to fear of rejection or disagreement within the group. Group members will measure success based on the harmony of their group and not by the outcome of their decisions. One way to counteract groupthink is to have members of a group be from <b>diverse backgrounds</b> and have different characteristics (gender, age, nationality). Another way to avoid groupthink is to require each member to suggest different ideas.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b><u>Working in teams has also shown to be very beneficial. Some advantages of teamwork include:</u></b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><mark>Problem solving:</mark> A group of people can bring together various perspectives and combine views and opinions to rapidly and effectively solve an issue. Due to the team's culture, each team member has a responsibility to contribute equally and offer their unique perspective on a problem to arrive at the best possible solution.Teamwork can lead to better decisions, products, or services. The effectiveness of teamwork depends on the following six components of collaboration among team members:<b><em>communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion.</em></b></p></li>
                <li><p><mark>Individual qualities:</p></mark>Every team member can offer their unique knowledge and ability to help improve other team members. Through teamwork the sharing of these qualities allows team members to be more productive in the future.</p></li>
