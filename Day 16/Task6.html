    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language used mainly for web
            development.</li>
        <li>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape.</li>
        <li>JavaScript makes web pages interactive and dynamic.</li>
        <li>It runs directly in the browser without needing any special installation.</li>
        <li>JS works with HTML (structure) and CSS (style) to build complete web pages.</li>
        <li> It is an interpreted language, meaning code runs line by line.</li>
        <li> JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.</li>
        <li>It can respond to user actions like clicks, scrolls, and keypresses.</li>
        <li> JS is case-sensitive — Variable and variable are different.</li>
        <li> Variables in JS can be declared using var, let, or const.</li>
        <li>It supports data types such as string, number, Boolean, object, and array.</li>
        <li>Functions in JavaScript allow you to reuse code easily.</li>
        <li>The DOM (Document Object Model) lets JS change HTML content
            dynamically.</li>
        <li> JavaScript is an event-driven language, reacting to user or system events.</li>
        <li>It supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and
            async/await.</li>
        <li> Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server-side.</li>
        <li>Popular JavaScript frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.</li>
        <li> JS can be used to fetch data from servers using APIs (e.g., fetch () method).</li>
        <li> It is platform-independent, meaning it works across operating systems and
            devices.</li>
        <li> JavaScript continues to evolve — the latest version is part of the ECMAScript
            (ES) standard.</li>
    </ul>
