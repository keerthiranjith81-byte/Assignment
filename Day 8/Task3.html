    <h1 align="center"><u>Politics :</u></h1>
    <p>Politics is the system, process, and practice through which people make decisions, govern societies, and exercise
        authority. It influences nearly every aspect of life, from the laws we follow and the taxes we pay to the
        services we receive, such as healthcare and education. Understanding politics helps citizens participate
        actively in shaping their communities and nations. Politics can be explored through several key areas:</p>

    <h2><u>Government Systems :</u></h2>
    <p>Different countries operate under varied systems of governance. In democracies, leaders are elected by the
        people, allowing citizens to have a direct say in decision-making. In monarchies, power is often hereditary,
        while in authoritarian regimes, authority is concentrated in the hands of a few leaders or a single party. Each
        system impacts how policies are made and how citizens can engage in political life.</p>

    <h3><u>Political Parties and Elections :</u></h3>
    <p>Political parties represent diverse ideologies, interests, and goals. Elections are a vital part of politics,
        enabling citizens to select leaders who reflect their views. Campaigns, debates, manifestos, and voting
        processes ensure that the government remains accountable. The competition between parties encourages the
        development of policies that aim to serve public interests.</p>

    <h4><u>Public Policy and Laws :</u></h4>
    <p>Politics shapes the rules and regulations that govern society. Laws influence education, healthcare,
        environmental protection, infrastructure, and the economy. Public policy is designed to address social issues,
        allocate resources, and maintain order. Effective policymaking balances short-term needs with long-term
        development and stability.</p>

    <h5><u>International Politics and Relations :</u></h5>
    <p>Politics is not confined to a single country. Nations interact through diplomacy, trade agreements, and
        international organizations like the United Nations. Decisions made in one country can have global consequences,
        affecting peace, security, and economic stability worldwide.</p>
