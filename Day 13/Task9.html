    <h1>Responsive Font Sizes</h1>
    <h2>Using rem and em units</h2>
    <p>
        This paragraph uses <strong>1rem</strong> for font size.
        When the screen size decreases, the base font size on the html element changes,
        which automatically makes text smaller.
    </p>
    <p>On Monday, I watched OpenAI CEO Sam Altman drink from a gigantic mango-flavored juice box and remark aloud about
        how the box was half his size. The catch: It wasn't really Altman. The juice box wasn't real. He wasn't really
        talking. It was a deepfake generated by AI.</p>

    <p class="small-text">
        This is smaller text using <strong>0.875em</strong> — it scales relative to its parent element.
        The social app is also called “Sora” and it's available now via iOS to users in the US and Canada on an
        invite-only basis. More countries will follow, and each user will receive four additional invites to share with
        friends.Some of the clips were generated live as we watched, and they were terrifyingly realistic — no more
        six-fingered hands (that I could see, at least). Unless the video contained fantastical subject matter, like the
        gigantic juice box example, the untrained eye may not be able to tell that these videos were AI-generated — and
        if you could tell, it would likely be based simply on a feeling, or a vibe, of something feeling off.
