Why this is better then div :
    1.Sematic meaning:
      # header = tells browers and screen readers "this is the top of the page".
      # main = main content of the page.
      # section = groups related content with a heading.

    2.SEO(Search Engine Optimization):
         Search engines know which page is important(like about me,subject).
