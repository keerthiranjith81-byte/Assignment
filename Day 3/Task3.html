            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Although our business has evolved over the years, one constant is customers' desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenient services. Today, Amazon shoppers can find what they're looking for online and in person. From delivering fresh produce to their doorstep to creating and distributing movies, music, and more, we are always finding new ways to delight our customersOur passion for delighting customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. Working backward from customer needs, we're constantly seeking to improve our services, add benefits and features, and invent new products. With this in mind, over the years we've launched innovative services such as Prime, Alexa and our family of Echo devices, award-winning entertainment, and exclusive Amazon products.</p>

            <h2>Working At Amazon</h2>
            <p>Amazon's workplace is made up of a talented, global team of individuals who work hard every day to create a great experience for customers, employees, partners, and the communities where we serve. We have hired more U.S. jobs in the last decade than any other company, with an average hourly base pay of $23 across our fulfillment and transportation network and pharmacy, and the majority of our comprehensive benefits begin on day one of employment. We have invested over $1.2 billion on free skills training to help employees further their careers.Amazon fosters a culture of ownership, where employees are empowered to develop, build, and own big ideas. Being a builder comes with an appetite for risk taking. Founder Jeff Bezos calls Amazon “the best place in the world to fail.” Employees take ownership of their careers here, and we believe people grow faster at Amazon than they would anywhere else.</p>

            <h2>Leadership Principles</h2>
            <p>We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Amazon Leadership Principles through our actions every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Amazon does business, how leaders lead, and how we keep the customer at the center of our decisions. Our unique Amazon culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps us relentlessly pursue our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company, best employer, and safest place to work.Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>

            <h3>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shares the simple question that helps power Amazon's innovation</h3>
            <p>In this year's annual letter to shareholders, Jassy explains that Amazon is a Why company: "It frames the way we think about everything that we do."</p>

            </div>
            <p>Every year in his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy tries to share insight into what makes Amazon tick.</p>
            <p>In this year's letter, he says at the highest level, Amazon is aiming to be Earth's most customer-centric company, making customers' lives better and easier every day. And Jassy says that, "If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything around us."</p>
            <p>We've had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way door decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where you were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. You can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-way door decision is one where it's quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if you get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs assume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed bolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we've found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors has been a simple question: “Why?”</p>
