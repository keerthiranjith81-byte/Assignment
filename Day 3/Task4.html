       <p>On Monday, I watched OpenAI CEO Sam Altman drink from a gigantic mango-flavored juice box and remark aloud about how the box was half his size. The catch: It wasn't really Altman. The juice box wasn't real. He wasn't really talking. It was a deepfake generated by AI.</p>
       <p>The most concerning part: I couldn't tell whether or not it was real.</p>
       <p>OpenAI announced Sora 2, its new AI video- and audio-generation system, on Tuesday, and in a briefing with reporters on Monday, employees called it the potential “ChatGPT moment for video generation.” Just like ChatGPT, Sora 2 is being released as a way for consumers to play around with a new AI tool — one that includes a social media app with the ability to create realistic videos of real people saying real things. You could say it's essentially an app full of deepfakes. On purpose.</p>
       <p>OpenAI believes Sora, which was first announced in February 2024 and released that December, has finally reached a point of relative reliability. Bill Peebles, OpenAI's head of Sora, compared the video-generation system's earliest iteration to a “slot machine” where “you would put a prompt in and kind of cross your fingers that what you got out bore any resemblance to what you asked for.” The new model, he said, “is way better in terms of being faithful to how users prompt it.”</p>
       <p>During the briefing, the team behind Sora 2 said they had been working on it for at least 20 months. The biggest step change in the product is that it can now generate audio that's synchronized with video — not just background soundscapes and sound effects, but also dialogue that works for a range of languages. Its available through Sora.com, “with Sora 2 Pro available to ChatGPT Pro users,” and developers are set to receive API access “soon.”</p>
       <p>The social app is also called “Sora” and it's available now via iOS to users in the US and Canada on an invite-only basis. More countries will follow, and each user will receive four additional invites to share with friends.Some of the clips were generated live as we watched, and they were terrifyingly realistic — no more six-fingered hands (that I could see, at least). Unless the video contained fantastical subject matter, like the gigantic juice box example, the untrained eye may not be able to tell that these videos were AI-generated — and if you could tell, it would likely be based simply on a feeling, or a vibe, of something feeling off.</p>
