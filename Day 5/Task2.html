        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a revered Indian scientist, statesman, and the 11th President of India (2002-2007), born in Rameswaram in 1931. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his pivotal role in developing the nation's missile and nuclear programs, including the Pokhran-II nuclear tests. A visionary leader, he also served at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was celebrated as the "People's President" for his humility and inspirational connection with the youth. Kalam authored popular books like Wings of Fire. He played a crucial role in the SLV-III satellite launch vehicle project.</p>
        <p>Awarded India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, he was a strong advocate for self-reliant technology. Kalam championed the idea of a developed India and inspired generations to dream big. He died on July 27, 2015. His humble beginnings in Rameswaram, despite poverty, made his journey particularly inspiring, according to <a href="https://www.firstcry.com/intelli/articles/apj-abdul-kalam-essay-for-children-10-lines-short-and-long-essay/" target="_blank">Fristcry</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/A-P-J-Abdul-Kalam" target="_blank">Britannica.</a></p>
         <h2>Presidency:</h2>
         <p>In 2002 India's ruling <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Democratic-Alliance-political-organization-India" target="_blank">National Democratic Alliance (NDA)</a> put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing Pres. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kocheril-Raman-Narayanan" target="_blank">Kocheril Raman Narayanan</a>. Kalam's stature and popular appeal were such that he was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA despite his being Muslim, and even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the vote of the electoral college, defeating former revolutionary leader Lakshmi Sahgal. He was sworn in as India's 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country's first woman president.</p>
