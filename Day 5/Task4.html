       <p style="color: blue;">Friendships can have a big effect on your health and well-being. But it's not always easy to make or keep friends. Understand the importance of social connection in your life. Know what you can do to build and fuel lasting friendships.</p>
       <p style="color: yellowgreen;">Many adults find it hard to make new friends or keep the ones they have. Work or caring for children or aging parents might come before friends. You and your friends may have grown apart due to changes in your lives or interests. Or maybe you've moved to a new town and haven't yet found a way to meet people.Making and keeping good friends takes effort. The pleasure, comfort and health benefits you can get from friends make it worth the effort.</p>
       <p style="color: red;">f you think of someone you'd like to know better, reach out. That first step is often the hardest. But it might be easier to take than you think. Ask people who know both of you to put you in touch with a text, email, phone call or visit. Invite the person to coffee or lunch.To meet new people who might become friends, go to places where people gather. Use more than one way to meet people. The more you try, the easier it gets. And the more you're likely to succeed.Keeping at it also matters. Reach out instead of waiting for others to come to you. Keep trying. You may need to suggest plans a few times before you can tell if a new friend wants to be with you.</p>
       <p style="color: violet;">Joining a chat group or online community might help you make or keep friends and help you feel less lonely. But research suggests that use of social networking sites doesn't always lead to a larger offline network or closer offline links with network members. Also, be careful when sharing information about yourself. And take care when meeting with someone you've met online.</p>
       <p style="color: brown;">Making and keeping friends involves give-and-take. Sometimes you're the one giving support. Other times you're getting it. Letting friends know that you care about them can help strengthen your bond. It's as important for you to be a good friend as it is to have good friends.</p>
