    <p id="subject" class="Maths" title="Favorite subject">My favorite subject is Maths because it is both challenging and fun. I enjoy solving problems, finding patterns, and using logic to get the right answers. Maths helps me think clearly and improves my problem-solving skills. Whether it’s addition, subtraction, geometry, or algebra, every topic feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved. I also love how maths is used in our daily lives — from shopping and cooking to time and travel. Studying maths gives me confidence and makes me feel smart whenever I find the correct solution.</p>
    <p id="food" class="Briyani" title="Favorite food">My favorite food is biryani, a dish that never fails to make my mouth water. The moment its rich aroma fills the air, I know I'm in for a treat. Biryani is a perfect blend of fragrant basmati rice, tender meat, and a mix of aromatic spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. Each bite bursts with flavor — a balance of spice, sweetness, and a hint of tanginess from the yogurt and herbs. What I love most is how every layer of rice hides juicy, flavorful pieces of chicken or mutton, cooked to perfection. Whether served with cool raita, spicy gravy, or crispy fried onions on top, biryani is more than just food — it's an experience. It reminds me of family gatherings, celebrations, and the warmth of home. To me, biryani is not just my favorite dish; it's a plate full of happiness and tradition.</p>
    <p id="Fruit" class="pineapple" title="Favorite friut">My favorite fruit is pineapple. It is a tropical fruit with a sweet and tangy taste that always refreshes me. The yellow, juicy flesh is full of flavor, and its pleasant smell makes it even more tempting. I love eating pineapple slices on hot days or drinking fresh pineapple juice. It reminds me of summer and makes me feel cheerful every time I eat it.</p>
    <p id="vegetable" class="potato" title="favorite vegetable">My favorite vegetable is potato. It is one of the most common and versatile vegetables in the world. Potatoes can be cooked in many delicious ways — boiled, fried, baked, or mashed — and they always taste amazing. I love crispy french fries, spicy potato curry, and creamy mashed potatoes. The soft texture and mild flavor of potatoes make them a perfect match with almost any dish. They are also full of energy and keep me feeling full for a long time. For me, potatoes are simple yet special, and I can enjoy them any day in any form.</p>
